In this undergraduate thesis, the application of machine learning models to predict the success of football players at new clubs is investigated. By leveraging extensive football data, including player attributes, historical performance indicators, and contextual elements, the study aims to develop predictive models capable of anticipating a player's impact upon joining a new club. Through a mixed-methods approach combining quantitative analysis and qualitative insights, the research seeks to provide football clubs with valuable tools for talent assessment and acquisition, ultimately enhancing decision-making processes in player recruitment strategies. The study also discusses the shortcomings of subjective assessments and conventional scouting techniques in effectively estimating player potential and makes the case for data-driven player recruitment tactics. The study tries to discover important performance indicators and contextual components that greatly influence a player's success in a new club environment by evaluating historical player performance data. The project aims to provide practical insights and recommendations to enhance competitive advantage in the ever-changing football scene by optimizing team composition through the development and assessment of machine learning models
